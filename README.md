# Income-Consumption-Regression-
This project explores the relationship between income and consumption using statistical and machine learning techniques. The analysis includes data visualization (scatter plots, histograms, Q-Q plots), linear regression modeling, and diagnostic checks for key assumptions like linearity, normality, and homoscedasticity. Additionally, machine learning methods such as random forest are implemented to compare predictive performance. The repository provides a comprehensive R script for reproducibility, along with a dataset for hands-on practice. Ideal for data science learners, this project demonstrates regression analysis, model evaluation, and visualization in R, making it a valuable resource for statistical modeling and predictive analytics.
